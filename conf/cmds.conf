# commands
#
# CMD  - command, key unique
# OBJ  - object type
# TERMINAL - terminal required
#  0- may run in background
#  1- writes some info to stdout
#  2- requires a terminal to show dialogs
# USROPT  - command has a parameter for user name
# ABV  - abbreviated key
# ACC  - simplified command name
# NCURSES  - display string for dialog-ncurses
# NAME - short description
#
# --colors
# Interpret embedded "\Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character,
# which tells dialog to set colors or video attributes:
# 0 through 7 are the ANSI used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.
# Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'. Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.
# Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.
# The settings are cumulative, e.g., "\Zb\Z1" makes the following text bold (perhaps bright) red.
# Restore normal settings with "\Zn".
